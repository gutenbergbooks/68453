    “Tick-tock! Tick-tock!” said the clock.
    “The rolls are brown,” said Mary.
    “May I call Father and John?
    Come, Father! Come, John!
    Here are some hot rolls,
    Mother and I made them for you.”

    I have a little sister,
      They call her “Peep-peep!”
    She wades in the water
      Deep, deep, deep.
    She climbs up the hillside,
      High, high, high.
    Poor little sister
      Has but one eye.

    Dear little Baby, go to sleep.
    Mother will sing you to sleep.
    Rock-a-by! Rock-a-by!
    Sleep, pretty Baby! Sleep!
    Dear little birds, go to sleep.
    Up so high! Up so high!
    The wind will rock you to sleep.
    Rock-a-by! Rock-a-by!

    I am a star.
    They call me “Peep-peep!”
    I peep into Baby’s cradle.
    Baby is fast asleep.
    I peep into the little nests.
    The pretty birds are asleep.
    They are asleep, Baby and birds.

    One hot morning Mary said,
    “Mother, may I wade in the water?”
    “Yes, the water is not deep.”
    “May Baby Sister wade, too?
    She likes to play in the water.”
    “Baby Sister is too little.
    Take Rover with you.
    He likes to play in the water.”

    Here, Rover! Come, Rover!
    I am going to wade in the water.
    You may come with me, Rover.
    Mary went down to the water.
    Rover and Pussy went with her.
    Do you know what they saw?
    They saw a frog.

    Rover said, “Bow-wow!”
    Pussy Cat said, “Meow! Meow!”
    Mary said, “Oh, oh! Who are you?
    Will you play with me, little frog?
    Here is a fly for you.
    Come and get the fly.
    Rover will not catch you.
    Pussy will not catch you.
    Do not go away, little frog.”

THE LITTLE RED HEN

    A little red hen saw some wheat.
    “Who will plant this wheat?” she said.
    “I will not,” said the rat.
    “I will not,” said the cat.
    “I will not,” said the pig.
    “I will, then,” said the little red hen.
    So she planted the wheat.

    When the wheat was ripe, she said,
    “Who will take this wheat to the mill?”
    “I will not,” said the rat.
    “I will not,” said the cat.
    “I will not,” said the pig.
    “I will, then,” said the little red hen.
    So she took the wheat to the mill.

    When the wheat was made into flour, she said,
    “Who will make this flour into bread?”
    “I will not,” said the rat.
    “I will not,” said the cat.
    “I will not,” said the pig.
    “I will, then,” said the little red hen.
    So she made the flour into bread.

    When the bread was made, she said,
    “Who will eat this bread?”
    “I will,” said the rat.
    “I will,” said the cat.
    “I will,” said the pig.
    “No, you will not,” said the hen.
    “I am going to eat it myself.”
    So the little red hen ate the bread.
